# Alpine Workspace

Basic Linux command line workspace to normalize dev tools across a team.

This is deployed using Docker, not Kuberenetes.  For local volumes, it's just easier.

*Note for Windows*: May need to run `docker run -it -v C:/:/data alpine sh` to force Windows to ask permission to share drive
